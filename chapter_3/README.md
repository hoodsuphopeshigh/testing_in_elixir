# Testing in Elixir: Chapter 3

## Description

This repo is an accompaniment to the blog found at:
[Testing in Elixir: Chapter 3]()

This chapter focuses on how to test external API calls using mocks, behaviours and explicit contracts.

This is inspired by the approach explained in this blog:
[Platformatec: Mocks and explicit contracts](http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2015/10/mocks-and-explicit-contracts/)

It is something that I personally have had great success with in production applications.

## Installation

Before using please run the following:

`mix deps.get && mix deps.compile`
