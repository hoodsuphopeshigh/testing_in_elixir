# Testing in Elixir

## Description

This repo is for a series of blog posts about testing in Elixir.

Testing in general is great, it is useful, and it helps you improve as a developer.

Elixir is also great, so let's combine the two and understand how to test our application.

Bonus points as testing in Elixir is a dream and actually pretty sane.
